## Topic: Using Machine Learning to Classify Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Severity from MRI Scans

This repository contains my work based on the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01428.pdf) "Identifying Alzheimer Disease Dementia Levels Using Machine Learning Methods" by Md Gulzar Hussain and Ye Shiren. I have created a PowerPoint presentation, Recording, and a Medium article explaining the study's approach in using machine learning to classify Alzheimer's disease severity from MRI scans.



## Overview

The original research focuses on applying machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to classify Alzheimer's disease severity. This is achieved by processing MRI images using these advanced algorithms. My work here delves into the details of this research, providing an accessible explanation through a presentation and an article.


## Presentation
